Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 Monacoin is a peer-to-peer Internet currency that enables instant,
 near-zero cost payments to anyone in the world. Monacoin is an open 
 source, global payment network that is fully decentralized without 
 any central authorities. Mathematics secures the network and empowers
 individuals to control their own finances. Monacoin features faster 
 transaction confirmation times and improved storage efficiency than 
 the leading math-based currency. With substantial industry support, 
 trade volume and liquidity, Monacoin is a proven medium of commerce 
 complementary to Bitcoin.
